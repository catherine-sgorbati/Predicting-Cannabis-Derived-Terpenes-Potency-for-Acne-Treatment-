# Predicting-Cannabis-Derived-Terpenes-Potency-for-Acne-Treatment
This repository explores the potential of cannabis-derived terpenes as alternative treatments for acne through machine learning predictions. Acne is often treated with methods that have side effects or lead to antibiotic resistance, so this project leverages terpenes’ anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties as a safer option. Using data from ChEMBL, machine learning models—Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost—predict terpene potency against acne-related targets (ADA, IL-2, and EP4). Comparisons between active and passive learning reveal active learning’s advantage in predictive accuracy. Key findings indicate Beta Pinene as a promising candidate for acne treatment, potentially advancing terpene-based therapies.
